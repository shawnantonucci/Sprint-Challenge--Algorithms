Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

Example a: O(n)
    While loop multiplies n with each loop

Example b:  O(n^3)
    there are three nested loops where its iterating the number of operations in each

Example c: O(n)
    using recursive function this problem would be linear


# Exercise II

building_floor = n
current_floor = f

while f in range(len(n) - 1):
    if f  > current_floor:
        print("Egg broke")
return f

This would be O(n)
